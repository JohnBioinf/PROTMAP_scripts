<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This track shows the transcriptomic expression.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The transcriptome data were taken from the bioproject
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA655119">PRJNA655119</a>
and mapped with
<a href="https://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/segemehl/">segemehl</a> to
an index comprising the eight SIHUMIx species as separate chromosomes. Default
parameters were used. Annotation files were generated with
<a href="http://www.htslib.org/">samtools</a>. Total expression per species was
averaged over all replicates.</p>
